Hi, I'm Travis, I'm a web gardner. This is my garden.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy making things, art, photos, vegan pizzas, and bitchen websites. In my consulting work 
I primairly use Elixir, Phoenix with a splash of Ruby but I've been known to use, JavaScript (React,
NextJS, Svelte and Sveltekit, etc.), Python (Django), PHP and the CraftCMS. This website is built 
with Svelte and Sveltekit my primairy choice for JS development.
