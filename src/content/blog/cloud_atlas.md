A phenomenal read, I was thoroughly hooked into this book from 1849 to 2346. I haven't read anything quite like this; in the hands of a less talented writer, structurally, it could have been a bit gimmicky.
However; Mitchell is talented provide one compelling story after another. Initially I worried that _The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing_ and _Sloosha's Crossin' an' Evrythin' After_ were going to drag because of the verbosity or eccentricity (respectively) of the language but after a few pages I was engrossed in both.
