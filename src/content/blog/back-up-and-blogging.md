In conjunction with me finally overhauling my website I've decided to get on the blogging train. I've had a personal blog on and off since at least 2005.  I started when I was 12 or 13 just adding text to a an HTML file and copying it into Geocities then Tripod then Dreamhost.  Sometime around 2006 or 2007 I did the "Famous Five Minute Install" of WordPress and stayed the course there for a few years. As I've been reworking my site with SvelteKit I toyed with the idea of doing a Markdown blog. While I like this approach, in theory, I really missed the administration tools that a more full-fledged platform offers, drafts, the ability to post on the fly without having to run a deployment, etc. In the past I've solved those pain points with TinaCMS for clients but frankly it's just more trouble than I'm willing to put in for a personal site.
 
So with that I've chosen Ghost.  I've always liked the Ghost ethos, small, remote-first, transparent non-profit. I used Ghost a few years back to document [my year of consuming less](https://consume.travisfantina.com/) . I'm not a huge fan of the Medium-like editor they use but their overall aesthetic is on point. I'm not 100% positive what I'm going to post here. I'm a developer by trade so I may write some technical articles; but for the most part this is going to be a collection of my public thoughts and ideas.  Mostly short-form with some longer form stuff peppered in.  Moving forward I'm going to tweak this template to handle single photos and short form micro posts. The goal being, this can be the central repository for all my online life.
