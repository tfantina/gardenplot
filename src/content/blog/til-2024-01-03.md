You can use Erlang's `tc` function to see how many microseconds a function takes.  For example, say you were curious if `Enum.filter/2` or `Kernel.--/2` took longer:

Example: 
```elixir
$iex> vals = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
$iex> :timer.tc(Enum, :filter, [vals, &rem(&1, 2) == 1])
{20, [1, 3, 5]}

$iex> :timer.tc(Kernel, :--, [vals, [2, 4]])
{3, [1, 3, 5]}
```

`Kernel.--` or `vals -- [2, 4]` took 3 micro seconds while `Enum.filter/2` (`Enum.filter(vals, & &1rem(&1, 2) == 1)`) took 20.  

This is a fairly trivial example but I could see this coming in handy with larger operations.
