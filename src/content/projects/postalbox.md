PostalBox is a little project with a simple idea; sending letters via the internet. Imagine a service like email but the missive comes to your house instead of your inbox,
yes, crazy but believe it or not that was once the norm it was called mail, or the post! I've strived to recreate some of that magic with PostalBox.  

It's not up and running quite yet but you can check it out [here](https://postalbox.xyz/).
