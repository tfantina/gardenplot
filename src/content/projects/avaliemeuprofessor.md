I served as a co-founder/CTO for a Brazilian based 'Rate My Professors' type of website.  We 
launched with a few dozen reviews and struggled to gain traction. I learned Ruby and Rails 
with this site and it was refreshing to be able to focus 100% on the technical sides of the 
business while my friend focused on the business/marketing.  

It was with this project that I realized I'd rather write code than start businesses.

The [source code](https://github.com/tfantina/Avalie-Meu-Professor) is pretty vanilla.
