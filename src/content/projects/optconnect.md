I built Optconnect's Marketing site with CraftCMS, an elegant and opinionated alternative to WordPress. Over the 
years I've been able to work on several different Craft projects. The ecosystem is noticeably smaller than 
WordPress (as to be expected), but in my experience the sites are easier to setup, manage and troubleshoot.
Craft is a bit more opinionated, you won't find any plugins to reskin your entire admin panel, but once you
know it you can jump into any Craft instance and be up and running in no time.

Over the years I've continued to offer support and updates to OptConnect as needed.

Optconnect had a lot of interesting shapes and elements which made for some interesting frontend challenges. On mobile screens 
we opted to have the products displayed via a slider (see above) which allowed you to scroll horizontally to see more categories (above).

Part of the work I did for OptConnect included migrating a WordPress blog to Craft. This included building a custom search tool with 
CraftCMS.
