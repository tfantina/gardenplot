Consulting for an agency projects tend to come and go but I’ve been a constant on two big Elixir projects beginning in the fall of 2019 and the summer of
2020 respectively. These are not trivial sites, they interface directly with the clients’ accounting services (in one case a large ERP system) and handles over a million dollars of transactions a day.
I can’t go into client details but I can detail some of my responsibilities.  I took over as the lead developer on both projects in March of 2022 and have continued to actively maintain them. Generally, I am
the sole contributor on these projects working hand in hand with a PM and the client directly to troubleshoot bugs, refine and implement new features. Occasionally, as demand and budgets have allowed another developer has been
added to the project, in such cases I provide a technical orientation and PR reviews.`,s,i,p="Both projects are large Phoenix monoliths and is almost entirely LiveViews.
